# Twan Separation Kernel

A lightweight separation kernel with dynamic routing capabilities

## Overview

Twan is a Separation Kernel designed specifically for adaptability, real-time computing, and mixed-criticality workloads. It consists of two distinct components:

- **Twanvisor**: A hypervisor that leverages hardware assisted virtualisation to isolate partitions. Guests are paravirtualised and use API's provided by Twanvisor.
- **TwanRTOS**: Root partition operating system that initializes Twanvisor, manages resources, and controls partition policies.

> **Note**: Twan is still in early stages of development.

## Support

Twan currently has support for Intel processors with: 

- **VT-x** 
- **EPTs** 
- **Unrestricted guest**

> **Note**: Even if your hardware fits these requirements, be aware that it may not work out of the box.

## Compliance

Twan is **not currently ARINC 653 or SKPP compliant** out of the box. Certification requires formal verification, safety analysis, and extensive validation beyond the current scope.
